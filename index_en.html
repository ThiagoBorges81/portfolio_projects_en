											<h1> Profissional Experience</h1>
										</header>

										<p>My professional background is in high performance human movement, where I have always developed viable solutions to improve competitiveness in sport.</p>

										<p>Not only did I work in the practical field, but I also produced academic research and mentored students.</p>

											<h2 id="content">4+ Complete Data Science Projecs</h2>
											<p>Construction of data solutions for business problems, close to real business challenges, using public data from Data Science competitions. Here, I approached the problems from the conception of the business challenge to the publication of the trained algorithm in production, using Cloud Computing tools.</p>

											<h2 id="content">18+ years as a Sports Scientist</h2>
											<p>Study and implementation of strategies to improve human performance in training and competitions. Routines for updating reports and metrics for steakholders.</p>

											<h2 id="content">18+ years as Exercise and Sport Science Researcher</h2>
											<p>Development of research and supervision of undergraduate and graduate students in the field of Physical Education, Sports Science and Exercise.</p>
											<p>My complete professional academic curriculum can be found <a href="https://lattes.cnpq.br/2778489679477951">here.</a></p>

											<h2 id="content">18+ years as Canoe Sprint coach</h2>

											<h3>Insights project for optimizing real estate purchases and sales</h3>
											<p>I used Python and its libraries for data analysis and statistics to detect properties with profit potential. Thus, properties could be bought by the company and sold with interesting profit margins. Purchase insights were based on property characteristics that include location, property size, number of rooms, among others. I built a web application using Streamlit and Streamlit Share to facilitate and optimize decision making by the company's stakeholders. The result of the presented solution, if implemented, would be an average profit of $71700.00 dollars per property.</p>
											<h4>Tools used in the project:</h4>
											<ul>
												<li>Python, Pandas, Numpy and Seaborn.</li>
												<li>Jupyter Notebook.</li>
												<li>Plotly and Folium interactive maps.</li>

											<h3>Sales prediction and renovation budget</h3>
											<p>"End-to-end" Data Science project, where I applied several techniques including CRISP-DS, machine learning models for data processing and sales forecasting of a (fictional) pharmacy chain. After presenting a business problem by the company's CFO, the requested task was to forecast sales revenue for six weeks, based on a supervised machine learning procedure. After detailed data processing and sending the model to production, a bot was created in Telegram, where the CFO would be able to access the forecasts of each store, through his cell phone.</p>
											<h4>Tools used in the project:</h4>
											<ul>
												<li>Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, requests, inflection, xgboost, scipy, boruta, matplotlib.</li>

											<h3>Rowing Race Data ETL.</h3>
											<p>In this project, I collected information from more than 250 PDF documents, with data from World Rowing Championships. It was necessary to download the files from a public source, where the PDFs were stored, create codes in Python and use specific libraries to extract all the content of each PDF file. Once the data was extracted in <em>string</em> format, I carried out all the formatting and processing to use the data in academic research.</p>

											<h3>Google Professional Data Analytics Certificate.</h3>
											<p>The Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate requires students to complete a case study to test skills learned during the course. This foundational project allows students to practice in a "real-world simulated scenario". This case study investigates the hypothetical scenario of a company called “Cyclistic”, which offers a shared bicycle service in Chicago, in the United States.</p>
